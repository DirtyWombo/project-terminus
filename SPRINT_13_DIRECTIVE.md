# Operation Badger: Sprint #13 Plan - Full Scale Validation
**DOCUMENT STATUS: FINAL - OFFICIAL SPRINT #13 DIRECTIVE**  
**DATE: 2025-07-27**  
**TO: Operation Badger Development Team**  
**FROM: Lead Quant**

## 1. Mission Assessment & Mandate

**Sprint #12 Outcome**: We have achieved a major breakthrough. The expanded universe test (45 stocks) delivered our first meaningful positive result with 22.29% annualized returns, exceeding our 15% target. This validates our hypothesis that the QVM strategy needs a larger opportunity set to succeed.

**New Mandate**: Sprint #13 will implement the two key optimizations identified in Sprint #12's analysis: full universe expansion and increased rebalancing frequency. This is our final validation test before potential deployment.

## 2. Sprint #13 Objective: Full Scale S&P 500 Weekly Rebalancing

**Hypothesis**: The Composite QVM strategy, when applied to the full S&P 500 universe (216 available stocks) with weekly rebalancing, will meet all four success criteria by providing sufficient trading opportunities and improved risk management through diversification.

**Why This Will Work**:
- **Maximum Opportunity Set**: 216 stocks vs 45 provides 5x more selection candidates
- **Weekly Rebalancing**: 52 rebalances/year vs 12 captures faster-moving opportunities
- **Enhanced Diversification**: Broader universe naturally reduces concentration risk

## 3. Execution Plan: Two Key Changes

### Task 1: Full Universe Implementation
**What**: Use the complete 216-stock S&P 500 universe already downloaded in `data/sprint_12/`

**How-To**:
1. Modify the test to use `curated_sp500_universe.txt` (216 stocks) instead of the test subset
2. Keep position count at 20 (same as Sprint 12)
3. Ensure cache system can handle the increased data volume

### Task 2: Weekly Rebalancing Implementation
**What**: Change rebalancing frequency from monthly to weekly

**How-To**:
```python
# Change from:
self.add_timer(when=bt.Timer.SESSION_START, monthdays=[1], monthcarry=True)

# To:
self.add_timer(when=bt.Timer.SESSION_START, weekdays=[1], weekcarry=True)
```

This will rebalance every Monday, providing 4x more opportunities to capture factor changes.

## 4. Sprint #13 Success Criteria

The same four criteria, but now we expect to meet them all:

✅ **Post-Cost Annualized Return > 15%** (Sprint 12: 22.29% ✓)  
✅ **Post-Cost Sharpe Ratio > 1.0** (Sprint 12: 0.91 ✗)  
✅ **Max Drawdown < 25%** (Sprint 12: 32.84% ✗)  
✅ **Total Trades > 50** (Sprint 12: 24 ✗)

## 5. Expected Improvements

Based on Sprint 12 results and our changes:

1. **Trade Count**: Should increase from 24 to 100+ (4x rebalancing frequency + larger universe)
2. **Sharpe Ratio**: Should exceed 1.0 (more trades = smoother returns)
3. **Max Drawdown**: Should drop below 25% (better diversification across 216 stocks)
4. **Returns**: Should maintain or exceed 22% (more opportunities to capture alpha)

## 6. Risk Considerations

- **Execution Time**: Full 216-stock universe with weekly rebalancing will take longer to backtest
- **Transaction Costs**: More trades means more commission impact - ensure 0.1% commission is applied
- **Cache Management**: Ensure PIT data cache is working to avoid excessive API calls

## 7. Significance

This is our most important test to date. If successful, we will have:
- A deployable strategy meeting all institutional criteria
- Proof that multi-factor models work with sufficient scale
- Validation of our point-in-time infrastructure at production scale

The progression from 10 stocks (Sprint 11) to 45 stocks (Sprint 12) to 216 stocks (Sprint 13), combined with the move from monthly to weekly rebalancing, represents the natural evolution of our strategy optimization.

## 8. Final Notes

Sprint 12's 22.29% return proves the strategy has alpha. Sprint 13's mission is to harness that alpha while controlling risk through diversification and more frequent rebalancing.

This is the culmination of our QVM research. Execute with precision.
