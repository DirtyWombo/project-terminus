## 🎯 **Apex Trader Funding 25K Evaluation Rules**

### **Account Parameters**
- **Starting Capital**: $25,000
- **Profit Goal**: $1,500 (must reach $26,500)
- **Trailing Threshold**: $1,500 (maximum drawdown from highest balance)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: None
- **Minimum Trading Days**: 7 days
- **Maximum Contracts**: 4 Mini contracts or 40 Micro contracts

### **The Terminus Governor - Critical Risk Management**

The Terminus Governor (`governor_apex.py`) is the heart of our risk management system:

**Core Responsibilities:**
1. **Real-time Drawdown Tracking**: Monitor account balance vs. highest watermark
2. **Trade Approval System**: Approve/deny trades based on remaining risk budget
3. **Position Sizing**: Enforce max contract limits (starting with 1 Micro /MES)
4. **Emergency Shutdown**: Halt all trading if approaching trailing threshold

**Risk Calculations:**
```
Current Risk Budget = Account Balance - (Highest Balance - $1,500)
If Risk Budget <= $100: EMERGENCY MODE - No new trades
If Risk Budget <= $50: CRITICAL MODE - Close all positions
```

### **Cost Structure**
- **Evaluation Fee**: ~$30 during promotions (lifetime access)
- **Reset Fee**: $100 if rules are broken
- **Activation Fee**: ~$130 one-time after passing
