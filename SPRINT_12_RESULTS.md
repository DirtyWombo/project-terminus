# Sprint 12 Results - S&P 500 Universe Expansion

**Test Date: January 27, 2025**  
**Universe: 45 S&P 500 stocks (top 50 by market cap)**  
**Positions: 20 (scaled up from 3)**

## üìä Executive Summary

Sprint 12 successfully scaled the QVM strategy from 10 to 45 S&P 500 stocks, achieving mixed results that provide valuable insights for strategy optimization.

### Key Results:
- ‚úÖ **Annualized Return: 22.29%** (TARGET: >15%) - PASS
- ‚ùå **Sharpe Ratio: 0.91** (TARGET: >1.0) - FAIL  
- ‚ùå **Max Drawdown: 32.84%** (TARGET: <25%) - FAIL
- ‚ùå **Total Trades: 24** (TARGET: >50) - FAIL

**Overall: 1/4 criteria met**

## üìà Performance Analysis

### Portfolio Metrics
- **Initial Value**: $100,000
- **Final Value**: $334,391
- **Total Return**: 234.39%
- **Win Rate**: 16.7% (concerning - only 4 winning trades out of 24)
- **Rebalances**: 72 (monthly over 6 years)

### What Improved from Sprint 11
1. **Trade Count**: Increased from 3 to 24 trades (8x improvement)
2. **Annualized Return**: Improved from 10.1% to 22.29%
3. **Universe Coverage**: Expanded from 10 to 45 stocks

### What Still Needs Work
1. **Drawdown Control**: 32.84% drawdown still exceeds 25% target
2. **Trade Frequency**: 24 trades over 6 years is still too low
3. **Win Rate**: 16.7% win rate suggests poor trade selection
4. **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.91 is below institutional standard of 1.0

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why Only 24 Trades?
Despite expanding to 45 stocks with 20 positions:
- Monthly rebalancing may be too infrequent
- QVM factors may be too stable (not enough ranking changes)
- Point-in-time data updates quarterly, limiting signal changes

### Why 32.84% Drawdown?
- Concentrated in growth/tech stocks (NVDA, META, GOOGL dominated)
- No sector diversification constraints
- Equal weighting without volatility adjustment
- Market downturns affect all positions similarly

### Why 16.7% Win Rate?
- Portfolio drift captures market beta, not alpha
- Few actual position changes despite monthly rebalancing
- QVM factors may not be predictive at monthly frequency

## üéØ Sprint 12 Insights

### Successes
1. **Infrastructure Proven**: PIT data system handled larger universe well
2. **Returns Achieved**: 22.29% annualized return shows potential
3. **Scaling Validated**: System successfully processes 45+ stocks

### Failures
1. **Risk Management**: Drawdown control still inadequate
2. **Signal Quality**: Low win rate indicates poor entry/exit timing
3. **Activity Level**: Still not generating enough trades for statistical significance

## üöÄ Recommendations for Sprint 13

### 1. Increase Trade Frequency
- Test weekly rebalancing instead of monthly
- Implement momentum-based position sizing
- Add technical triggers for entry/exit

### 2. Improve Risk Management
- Implement sector neutrality constraints
- Add volatility-based position sizing
- Consider stop-loss rules for individual positions

### 3. Expand Universe Further
- Test with full 216 S&P 500 stocks available
- This should provide more ranking changes and trade opportunities
- Greater diversification should reduce drawdown

### 4. Refine Factor Definitions
- Test alternative momentum windows (3-month, 12-month)
- Consider factor timing based on market regime
- Add quality metrics beyond ROE

## üìã Technical Notes

### Test Configuration
- **Backtest Period**: 2018-01-01 to 2023-12-31 (6 years)
- **Universe**: Top 45 S&P 500 stocks by market cap
- **Rebalancing**: Monthly on first trading day
- **Commission**: 0.1% per trade
- **Position Sizing**: Equal weight (5% per position)

### Data Quality
- All 45 stocks had complete price data
- 44/45 stocks had valid fundamental data (LIN missing pre-2019)
- Point-in-time data successfully eliminated lookahead bias

## üèÅ Conclusion

Sprint 12 demonstrates that universe expansion alone is insufficient to meet all performance criteria. While returns improved significantly, risk management and trade generation remain challenges.

The strategy shows promise but requires:
1. More frequent rebalancing
2. Better risk controls
3. Full S&P 500 universe (216 stocks)
4. Refined factor definitions

**Next Step**: Execute full 216-stock S&P 500 backtest with weekly rebalancing to address trade frequency issues.
