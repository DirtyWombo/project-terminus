## Lessons Learned & Strategic Insights

### 1. Infrastructure First Approach Validated
The decision to build custom options infrastructure (vs extending Backtrader) proved correct:
- **Flexibility:** Multi-leg strategies require specialized architecture
- **Performance:** Event-driven design scales better for options
- **Maintainability:** Clean separation enables rapid strategy development

### 2. Data Quality Critical for Options
Options data presents unique challenges vs equity data:
- **Wide Spreads:** 25% of contracts filtered for poor bid-ask spreads
- **Low Volume:** Significant filtering required for liquid contracts only
- **Greeks Validation:** Volatility surface modeling essential for accuracy

### 3. Professional Data Sources Essential
yfinance limitations for historical options data confirmed:
- **Coverage:** Limited to ~30 days historical
- **Quality:** Estimated Greeks vs professional calculations
- **Completeness:** Missing expiration chains for older dates

**Recommendation:** Theta Data subscription justified for production deployment.
