## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Channel not found" errors in logs
**Solution**: Normal if Cardea hasn't been invited to channels yet. Commands still work via DM.

**Issue**: Unicode encoding errors in console
**Solution**: Fixed in latest version. Doesn't affect functionality.

**Issue**: Commands not responding
**Solution**: Check Slack app token validity and bot permissions.

**Issue**: "No data available" responses  
**Solution**: Ensure trading system is running and state files exist.

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check if Cardea process is running
ps aux | grep cardea_slack_agent

# Check Slack connection
tail -f cardea_agent.log

# Verify state files exist
ls -la *_state.json live_trader_config.json
```
