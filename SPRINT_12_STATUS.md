# Sprint 12 Status - S&P 500 Universe Test

**Status: PREPARED BUT NOT EXECUTED**  
**Date: January 27, 2025**

## 📋 Sprint 12 Overview

Sprint 12 was designed to scale up the QVM strategy from 10 growth stocks to a diversified S&P 500 universe (216 stocks), addressing the key issues identified in Sprint 11:
- Low trade count (only 3 trades)
- High concentration risk (67.4% drawdown)
- Limited diversification

## 🔧 What Was Completed

### ✅ Infrastructure Setup
1. **Data Downloaded**: 216 S&P 500 stocks with full OHLCV data (2018-2023)
2. **Backtest Code Written**: `backtests/sprint_12/composite_qvm_backtest_sp500.py`
3. **Colab Notebook Created**: Ready for execution with Google Colab Pro
4. **Universe Expansion**: From 10 to 216 stocks across all sectors
5. **Position Scaling**: From 3 to 20 positions for better diversification

### ✅ Key Improvements Implemented
- **Larger Universe**: S&P 500 for institutional-grade coverage
- **Increased Positions**: 20 stocks instead of 3
- **Sector Diversification**: Full market representation
- **Trade Activity Target**: Added requirement for >50 trades

## ❌ What Was NOT Completed

### Execution & Results
- **Backtest Not Run**: The strategy was not executed
- **No Results Generated**: No performance metrics available
- **Success Criteria Not Evaluated**: Cannot assess if targets were met

## 🎯 Sprint 12 Success Criteria (Not Tested)

The strategy was designed to meet:
- Post-Cost Annualized Return > 15%
- Post-Cost Sharpe Ratio > 1.0
- Max Drawdown < 25%
- Total Trades > 50

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Sprint 12

### Option 1: Execute Locally
```bash
cd "C:\Users\antho\Desktop\cyberjackal stocks"
python backtests/sprint_12/composite_qvm_backtest_sp500.py
```

### Option 2: Execute on Google Colab Pro
1. Upload `Sprint_12_Colab_Notebook.ipynb` to Google Colab
2. Ensure Nasdaq Data Link API key is set in environment
3. Run all cells in the notebook
4. Review results and update documentation

### Option 3: Test with Smaller Universe First
```bash
python backtests/sprint_12/test_smaller_universe.py
```

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

Based on the infrastructure improvements:
- **Trade Count**: Should increase from 3 to 50+ trades
- **Drawdown**: Should decrease from 67% to <35% with diversification
- **Sharpe Ratio**: May improve with better risk distribution
- **Win Rate**: Should stabilize with larger sample size

## 🔑 Requirements for Execution

1. **Nasdaq Data Link API Key**: Must be set in `.env` file
2. **Python Environment**: All dependencies installed
3. **Computation Time**: ~10-20 minutes for full S&P 500 backtest
4. **Memory**: May require 8GB+ RAM for full universe

## 📝 Summary

Sprint 12 represents the natural evolution from Sprint 11's infrastructure success to a production-scale test. All preparation work is complete - only execution and analysis remain.

The expanded universe and increased position count directly address the limitations discovered in Sprint 11, positioning the strategy for potential institutional deployment if performance criteria are met.
