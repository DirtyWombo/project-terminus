## Technical Analysis: Why the Strategy Failed

### 1. Market Regime Incompatibility (2019-2023)
The backtest period included several challenging market conditions for volatility strategies:

- **2020 COVID Crash:** Extreme volatility expansion destroyed Iron Condors
- **2020-2021 Bull Market:** Consistent directional movement breached strikes
- **2022 Bear Market:** High volatility and trending markets
- **2023 Recovery:** Continued directional bias

### 2. Position Management Issues
**Stop Loss Triggered on Every Trade:**
- All 19 trades hit the 200% stop loss
- No trades reached the 50% profit target
- Average hold time of only 7.5 days suggests rapid losses

### 3. Volatility Timing Problems
**Poor Entry Conditions:**
- Strategy entered positions during volatile periods
- Iron Condors require stable, range-bound markets
- No volatility filtering beyond basic VIX thresholds

### 4. Transaction Cost Impact
**Real-World Costs Included:**
- $0.65 commission per contract (4 legs √ó 10 contracts = $26 per trade)
- $0.05 slippage per contract √ó 4 legs √ó 10 contracts = $200 per trade
- Exit costs for stop losses: Additional $226 per trade
- Total round-trip costs: ~$450 per trade minimum

### 5. Position Sizing Risk
**Excessive Risk per Trade:**
- 10 contracts per Iron Condor = $10,000 max loss potential
- With 200% stop loss = up to $20,000 actual loss per trade
- Multiple concurrent positions amplified losses

## Market Environment Analysis

### Historical Context: 2019-2023 Was Hostile to Iron Condors

**2019:** Trade war volatility and rate uncertainty  
**2020:** COVID crash and extreme volatility (VIX >80)  
**2021:** Meme stock volatility and trending markets  
**2022:** Federal Reserve tightening and bear market  
**2023:** Banking crisis and recovery volatility  

**Conclusion:** The test period included multiple "tail risk" events that are particularly damaging to short volatility strategies like Iron Condors.
